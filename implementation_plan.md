# Implementation Plan for ChimeraX Web Integration

## Overview
This implementation plan outlines the steps required to build a web application that integrates with UCSF ChimeraX for molecular visualization and editing. The system follows a three-tier architecture:
1. React Frontend: User interface with WebGL visualization
2. Node.js Backend: API endpoints and ChimeraX process management
3. ChimeraX Engine: Headless processes for molecular operations

## Core Components
The implementation is divided into the following core components:

### 1. Foundation and Infrastructure
- Project setup and basic Node.js backend
- ChimeraX process management system
- Session management and lifecycle handling

### 2. Core API Functionality
- Session creation and management endpoints
- File handling and storage system
- ChimeraX command execution API
- Structure retrieval and conversion endpoints

### 3. Advanced Features
- Structure modification operations
- Snapshot and rendering capabilities
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Authentication and authorization
- Persistent storage for user projects

### 4. Frontend Development
- Basic React UI with file management
- Molecular visualization (WebGL)
- Advanced visualization features
- User interface for structure modification

### 5. Production Readiness
- Resource monitoring and management
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Deployment configuration and documentation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Backend Infrastructure
Tasks: 1, 2, 3, 4
Focus: Set up the basic project structure and implement the ChimeraX process management system. Create session management API and file handling capabilities.

### Phase 2: ChimeraX Integration
Tasks: 5, 6, 7, 8
Focus: Develop the API endpoints for executing ChimeraX commands, retrieving and modifying structures, and rendering snapshots.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
Tasks: 9, 10
Focus: Create the React frontend with basic and advanced visualization capabilities.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
Tasks: 11, 12, 13
Focus: Implement WebSocket support, authentication, and persistent storage.

### Phase 5: Production Readiness
Tasks: 14, 15, 16
Focus: Add resource monitoring, testing, and prepare for deployment.

## Dependencies and Critical Path

The critical path for this project includes:
1. ChimeraX process management (Task 2) - This is foundational for all other tasks
2. Session Management API (Task 3) - Required for API endpoints
3. ChimeraX Command API (Task 5) - Core functionality for structure operations
4. Basic React Frontend (Task 9) - Required for user interaction

Tasks can be worked on in parallel within each phase, but phases generally depend on the completion of previous phases.
