# Getting Started with Hashi

Welcome to the Hashi user guide! This guide will help you get up and running with the Hashi ChimeraX Web Integration system, which provides a web-based interface for molecular visualization and analysis through UCSF ChimeraX.

## What is Hashi?

Hashi (æ©‹, "bridge" in Japanese) is a web application that bridges ChimeraX's powerful molecular visualization capabilities with the convenience and accessibility of a web interface. It allows you to:

- Visualize molecular structures directly in your browser with WebGL
- Upload and manage molecular structure files
- Create and manage ChimeraX sessions
- Render high-quality snapshots
- Modify molecular structures
- Collaborate on research projects

## System Requirements

To use Hashi, you need:

- A modern web browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Internet connection
- Account credentials (if your administrator has enabled authentication)

For administrators deploying Hashi, see the [Administrator Guide](../admin_guide/installation.md).

## Logging In

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the Hashi URL provided by your administrator.
2. If authentication is enabled, you'll see a login screen.
3. Enter your username and password, then click "Login".
4. You'll be redirected to the dashboard.

If you don't have an account, contact your system administrator or use the "Register" option if available.

## Dashboard Overview

After logging in, you'll see the main dashboard with several key areas:

![Dashboard Overview](../images/dashboard_overview.png)

1. **Header Bar**: Contains user information, session status, and global actions.
2. **Sidebar**: Navigation menu for different sections of the application.
3. **Main Content Area**: Displays the current view (structure viewer, file manager, etc.).
4. **Status Bar**: Shows current operations and system status.

## Quick Start: Visualizing a Molecule

Let's get started by visualizing a molecule:

1. From the dashboard, click "Upload Structure" in the sidebar.
2. Drag and drop a molecular structure file onto the upload area, or click to browse your files.
   - Supported formats: PDB, XYZ, MOL, MOL2, SDF, CIF
3. Once the file is uploaded, click "View" to open it in the molecular viewer.
4. The 3D structure will appear in the viewer window.

### Basic Navigation Controls

In the molecular viewer:
- **Rotate**: Click and drag with the left mouse button
- **Pan**: Click and drag with the right mouse button (or hold Shift + left mouse button)
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or pinch gesture (on touchscreen)
- **Reset View**: Click the "Reset View" button in the toolbar

## Managing Structures

Hashi allows you to organize and manage molecular structures:

1. Go to "My Structures" in the sidebar.
2. Here you can:
   - View a list of your uploaded structures
   - Preview thumbnail images
   - Search and filter structures
   - Delete unwanted structures
   - Tag and categorize structures
   - View structure metadata

## Creating and Managing Sessions

Sessions allow you to save the state of your visualization for later use:

1. When viewing a structure, click "Save Session" in the toolbar.
2. Give your session a name and description.
3. Click "Save".
4. To load a saved session, go to "My Sessions" in the sidebar and click on the session name.

## Next Steps

Now that you're familiar with the basics, explore more advanced features:

- [Structure Modification](structure_modification.md)
- [Rendering Options](rendering_options.md)
- [Snapshots and Exports](snapshots_exports.md)
- [Collaborating on Projects](collaboration.md)

If you encounter any issues, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) or contact your system administrator.
