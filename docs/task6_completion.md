# Task 6: Structure Retrieval API - Implementation Details

## Overview

Task 6 involved implementing a comprehensive Structure Retrieval API for the Hashi project, which integrates UCSF ChimeraX with a web application. The API provides endpoints for retrieving structural data from active ChimeraX sessions, including atom coordinates, bond information, molecular properties, and structure metadata.

## Components Implemented

1. **Data Types and Interfaces**
   - Defined comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for molecular structure data
   - Created enums for structure types and output formats
   - Implemented interfaces for filtering and query parameters

2. **Structure Retrieval Service**
   - Created a dedicated service for retrieving structure data from ChimeraX
   - Implemented efficient caching mechanisms for both metadata and large coordinate data
   - Developed methods for data transformation and format conversion

3. **API Controller**
   - Implemented a controller to handle HTTP requests
   - Added comprehensive error handling
   - Provided content negotiation for different output formats

4. **API Routes**
   - Defined RESTful endpoints for structure data retrieval
   - Implemented routes with proper middleware for authentication and validation
   - Added Swagger documentation for all endpoints

5. **Caching System**
   - Implemented a two-tier caching system for efficiency
   - Added cache invalidation mechanisms
   - Provided endpoints for manual cache management

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Structure Data Access

The API provides access to all levels of structural data:

- Complete structure data with all components
- Structure metadata (resolution, chains, residues, etc.)
- Atom coordinate data with element information
- Bond connectivity data
- Calculated molecular properties

### 2. Efficient Data Filtering

The API supports rich filtering capabilities for atom data:

- Filter by chains
- Filter by residues or residue ranges
- Filter by elements
- Filter by atom serial numbers
- Filter for specific molecular components (ligands, water, metals)
- Filter by distance from a point in 3D space

### 3. Multiple Output Formats

The API supports multiple output formats to meet different client needs:

- JSON for programmatic access
- PDB for molecular visualization software
- mmCIF for structure repositories
- SDF for chemistry tools
- MOL2 for docking software
- XYZ for computational chemistry

### 4. Performance Optimization

Several performance optimizations were implemented:

- Two-tier caching system with different TTLs for different data types
- Efficient response formatting
- Lazy loading of structure components
- Support for partial data retrieval

## Code Architecture

The structure retrieval system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Routes**: Handle URL mapping and request routing
2. **Controller**: Process HTTP requests and format responses
3. **Service**: Implement business logic and data retrieval
4. **Data Models**: Define structure and data formats

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were implemented for the Structure Retrieval API:

- Unit tests for the service methods
- Integration tests for the API endpoints
- Performance tests for caching mechanisms

## Documentation

The API is fully documented:

- Comprehensive API reference documentation
- Swagger annotations for all endpoints
- Example requests and responses
- Data models and interface descriptions
- Performance considerations and best practices

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Structure Retrieval API:

1. Support for additional output formats (MMTF, XML, etc.)
2. More advanced filtering capabilities (secondary structure, etc.)
3. Additional calculated properties (electrostatics, hydrophobicity, etc.)
4. Performance optimizations for very large structures
5. Streaming API for continuous data updates

## Conclusion

The Structure Retrieval API provides a robust foundation for accessing molecular structure data from ChimeraX sessions. Its comprehensive features, efficient implementation, and thorough documentation make it a valuable component of the Hashi project.
