# Task 9: Docker Environment with OSMesa Support - Completion

## Task Overview

This task focused on creating a robust Docker environment for the Hashi ChimeraX Web Integration application, with specific emphasis on resolving the OSMesa rendering issues that were causing the error: "ChimeraX rendering is unavailable. Using placeholder image instead."

## Completed Deliverables

1. **Docker Configuration**
   - Created multi-stage Dockerfile with proper ChimeraX and OSMesa support
   - Optimized for both size and performance
   - Added proper environment variables and dependencies

2. **Environment Detection**
   - Implemented automatic OSMesa capability detection
   - Added extensive testing scripts for verifying rendering functionality
   - Created robust fallback mechanisms

3. **Cross-Platform Development**
   - Configured development environment with hot-reloading
   - Ensured compatibility between macOS and Linux
   - Created shared volume system for easy development

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for testing and deployment
   - Added containerized test environment
   - Created build verification procedures

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive Docker setup guide (see docs/docker_setup.md)
   - Added troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Documented environment variables and configuration options

## Technical Solution

The core issue was identified as missing OSMesa libraries required for offscreen rendering in ChimeraX. The solution implements:

1. **Proper OSMesa Installation**
   - Added libosmesa6-dev package to the container
   - Configured proper OpenGL libraries and dependencies
   - Set appropriate environment variables (MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE, LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE)

2. **Virtual Framebuffer**
   - Implemented Xvfb for virtual display
   - Added robust startup procedure with verification
   - Created health checks to ensure display remains available

3. **Automatic Testing**
   - Added startup tests for ChimeraX and OSMesa functionality
   - Created visual verification with test rendering
   - Implemented diagnostic logging of OpenGL capabilities

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Added proper environment variable propagation
   - Created .env.example template file
   - Ensured consistent configuration between environments

## Usage Instructions

Detailed usage instructions are available in the docs/docker_setup.md file, but here's a quick summary:

1. **Production Environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Development Environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose --profile dev up --build
   ```

3. **Testing ChimeraX**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it hashi-app bash -c "export DISPLAY=:99 && chimerax --version"
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Continue integration with Dev 1's backend system
2. Work with Dev 4 to implement comprehensive testing
3. Optimize container size further if needed
4. Consider adding automated performance testing

## Conclusion

The Docker environment with OSMesa support has been successfully implemented and tested. The system now properly detects rendering capabilities and provides appropriate fallbacks. This resolves the "ChimeraX rendering is unavailable" error and ensures consistent behavior across development and production environments.
