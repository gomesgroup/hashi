### Phase 2: Days 3-5 - Core Implementation

#### Task 2.1: Unit Testing Framework (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implemented unit testing framework for backend
- ✅ Set up frontend component testing
- ✅ Created mocks for ChimeraX integration

The mock system has been implemented with a comprehensive `ChimeraXMockUtil` class that simulates different environments:

```typescript
// ChimeraX Mock Utilities
import { jest } from '@jest/globals';
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';
import { RenderingJobStatus, ImageFormat } from '../../src/server/types/rendering';

/**
 * Mock ChimeraX environment types
 */
export enum ChimeraXEnvironment {
  FULL_RENDERING = 'full_rendering',
  NO_OSMESA = 'no_osmesa',
  NO_CHIMERAX = 'no_chimerax',
  SLOW_RENDERING = 'slow_rendering',
  COMMAND_ERROR = 'command_error'
}

/**
 * ChimeraX Mock Utilities
 * 
 * Provides mock implementations for testing ChimeraX integration
 */
export class ChimeraXMockUtil {
  private static environment: ChimeraXEnvironment = ChimeraXEnvironment.FULL_RENDERING;
  
  /**
   * Set the mock environment for testing
   * @param environment Environment type
   */
  public static setEnvironment(environment: ChimeraXEnvironment): void {
    this.environment = environment;
  }
  
  /**
   * Create a mock of the child_process.spawn function
   */
  public static getMockSpawn(): jest.Mock;
  
  /**
   * Create a mock for testing REST API success/failure
   */
  public static getMockFetch(): jest.Mock;
  
  /**
   * Create a mock file system with testing utilities
   */
  public static getMockFileSystem(): any;
  
  /**
   * Generate a mock rendering job
   */
  public static createMockRenderingJob(jobId: string, sessionId: string, status?: RenderingJobStatus): any;
}
```

This mock system is fully implemented in `/tests/mocks/chimeraxMock.ts` and enables testing of all ChimeraX functionality including error cases and fallbacks.

#### Task 2.2: Integration Testing Setup (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Implemented API testing framework
- ✅ Set up end-to-end testing
- ✅ Created test data and fixtures

The integration tests are implemented in `/tests/integration/chimeraxApi.test.ts` and include testing for OSMesa failures:

```typescript
import { jest } from '@jest/globals';
import request from 'supertest';
import express from 'express';
import { ChimeraXEnvironment } from '../mocks/chimeraxMock';
import path from 'path';

// Import under test
import { chimeraxController } from '../../src/server/controllers/chimeraxController';

describe('ChimeraX API Integration Tests', () => {
  let app: express.Application;
  
  // Setup mock environment and Express app...
  
  describe('ChimeraX Command API', () => {
    it('should send a command to ChimeraX', async () => {
      const response = await request(app)
        .post('/api/chimerax/processes/test-session-id/command')
        .send({ command: 'open 1ubq' })
        .expect(200);
      
      expect(response.body.status).toBe('success');
    });
    
    it('should handle OSMesa errors properly', async () => {
      // Mock ChimeraX command failure due to OSMesa
      const chimeraXProcessManager = jest.requireMock('../../src/server/services/ChimeraXProcessManager').default;
      chimeraXProcessManager.sendCommand = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ 
        success: false, 
        error: 'Unable to save images because OpenGL rendering is not available' 
      });
      
      const response = await request(app)
        .post('/api/chimerax/processes/test-session-id/command')
        .send({ command: 'save snapshot.png' })
        .expect(404);
      
      expect(response.body.status).toBe('error');
      expect(response.body.message).toContain('OpenGL rendering is not available');
    });
  });
});
```

Additional tests for OSMesa detection and fallback mechanisms have been implemented in `/tests/osmesa.test.ts`. These tests verify that:

1. The system correctly detects when OSMesa is available
2. The system gracefully handles cases where OSMesa is not available
3. The fallback mechanisms work correctly
4. Error recovery is robust
5. Performance under different rendering conditions is acceptable

#### Task 2.3: Documentation Framework (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Created documentation site structure
- ✅ Set up API documentation generation
- ✅ Implemented style guide documentation

The documentation has been structured as follows:

1. **Testing Strategy Documentation** (`/docs/testing/OSMesa_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`)
   - Overview of testing approach
   - Test frameworks and tools
   - Testing levels and responsibilities
   - Running tests and interpreting results
   - Continuous integration setup

2. **Debugging Guide** (`/docs/testing/DEBUGGING_OSMESA.md`)
   - Common error messages and solutions
   - Platform-specific troubleshooting (Linux, macOS, Docker)
   - Logging and diagnostics
   - Verification scripts and tools
   - Fallback mechanisms

3. **API Documentation**
   - Updated integration points documentation
   - Added details on interface definitions and responsibilities
   - Created examples for testing with and without OSMesa

4. **Dependency Verification Tools**
   - Created script for verifying ChimeraX and OSMesa installation
   - Added platform-specific detection logic
   - Implemented documentation for troubleshooting dependency issues

### Phase 3: Days 6-7 - Integration & Testing

#### Task 3.1: Test Integration with Backend (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Worked with Dev 1 to test backend components
- ✅ Implemented backend API tests
- ✅ Documented backend test coverage
- ✅ Validated API error handling for OSMesa issues

We have verified that the backend API correctly handles OSMesa unavailability with appropriate error messages. Manual testing with the standalone server confirmed that:

```bash
# Testing snapshot endpoint (fails as expected on macOS)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"width":800,"height":600}' http://localhost:9876/api/chimerax/snapshot
{"status":"error","message":"Failed to create snapshot"}
```

The ChimeraX log correctly shows:
```
ERROR: Unable to save images because OpenGL rendering is not available
```

This triggers the front-end fallback mechanism appropriately.

#### Task 3.2: Test Integration with Frontend (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Worked with Dev 2 to test frontend components
- ✅ Implemented component tests
- ✅ Documented frontend test coverage

Frontend components have been tested with various ChimeraX environments:
- With fully working ChimeraX + OSMesa
- With ChimeraX but no OSMesa
- Without ChimeraX at all
- With slow rendering for timeout testing

Tests verify that fallback mechanisms work correctly in all scenarios.

#### Task 3.3: Test Container Environment (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Worked with Dev 3 to test containerized application
- ✅ Implemented Docker-based tests
- ✅ Documented container test results

Docker environment tests confirmed:
- ChimeraX is properly installed in the container
- OSMesa libraries are correctly configured
- All API endpoints function as expected
- Error handling works properly across environments

### Phase 4: Days 8-9 - Documentation & Quality Assurance

#### Task 4.1: Documentation Completion (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Finalized API documentation
- ✅ Created user guides
- ✅ Documented troubleshooting procedures

API documentation has been completed in `/docs/dev_guide/api.md`:

```markdown
