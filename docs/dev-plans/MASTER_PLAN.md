# Master Development Plan for ChimeraX Rendering Fix

## Overview

This master plan outlines a comprehensive approach to fixing ChimeraX rendering issues in our application, with tasks distributed among 4 developers working in parallel. The plan addresses cross-platform compatibility (macOS development, Linux deployment) and establishes communication protocols between team members.

## Team Assignments

| Developer | Role | Primary Responsibility | Files |
|-----------|------|------------------------|-------|
| Dev 1 | Backend Infrastructure | ChimeraX integration, REST API implementation | [01_BACKEND_INFRASTRUCTURE.md](./01_BACKEND_INFRASTRUCTURE.md) |
| Dev 2 | Rendering & Visualization | Rendering solutions, fallback mechanisms | [02_RENDERING_VISUALIZATION.md](./02_RENDERING_VISUALIZATION.md) |
| Dev 3 | Deployment & Environment | Containerization, cross-platform compatibility | [03_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md](./03_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md) |
| Dev 4 | Testing & Documentation | Testing framework, documentation, coordination | [04_TESTING_DOCUMENTATION.md](./04_TESTING_DOCUMENTATION.md) |

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Platform Compatibility**: All solutions must work on both macOS (development) and Linux (production)
- **Communication**: Update the [COORDINATION.md](./COORDINATION.md) file when making significant changes that affect other developers
- **Dependencies**: Document all dependencies in [DEPENDENCIES.md](./DEPENDENCIES.md)
- **Testing**: All features must have corresponding tests in the appropriate test directory

## Development Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Days 1-2 | Environment Setup & Problem Investigation |
| **Phase 2** | Days 3-5 | Core Implementation |
| **Phase 3** | Days 6-7 | Integration & Testing |
| **Phase 4** | Days 8-9 | Deployment & Documentation |
| **Phase 5** | Day 10 | Final Review & Launch |

## Critical Path

1. Dev 3: Establish consistent development environment → Dev 1, 2, 4: Continue work
2. Dev 1: Implement ChimeraX REST API → Dev 2: Implement visualization components
3. Dev 2: Complete visualization components → Dev 4: Test integration
4. Dev 3: Complete containerization → All: Test deployment
5. Dev 4: Finalize documentation → All: Review and launch

## Communication Protocol

- **Daily Updates**: Each developer must commit their progress by end of day
- **Blocking Issues**: Immediately update [BLOCKING_ISSUES.md](./BLOCKING_ISSUES.md) with any problems that block progress
- **Integration Points**: Document in [INTEGRATION_POINTS.md](./INTEGRATION_POINTS.md) when your code affects another developer's work

## Getting Started

1. Read your assigned plan document thoroughly
2. Check [DEPENDENCIES.md](./DEPENDENCIES.md) for required installations
3. Update [COORDINATION.md](./COORDINATION.md) with your start date/time
4. Begin with the first task in your plan
