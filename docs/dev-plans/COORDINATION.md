## Daily Updates

### 2025-03-17

**Dev 1:**
- Tasks completed:
  - Implemented robust ChimeraX process manager with error handling
  - Added OSMesa detection and fallback rendering options
  - Created placeholder image generation for when rendering fails
  - Enhanced REST API stability with connection error handling
  - Implemented multi-layered rendering fallback system
- In progress:
  - Finalizing integration with the frontend visualization
  - Testing cross-platform compatibility (macOS and Linux)
- Blockers:
  - None
- Notes for other devs:
  - Dev 2: The ChimeraX REST API now has proper error handling. When ChimeraX rendering is unavailable, it will automatically generate placeholder images.
  - Dev 3: The backend now detects and adapts to different rendering options (OSMesa, Xvfb, or placeholders).
  - Dev 4: Process manager and rendering queue have detailed logging for easier testing and debugging.

**Dev 4:**
- Tasks completed:
  - Created comprehensive ChimeraX mock system âœ…
  - Implemented tests for OSMesa detection and fallbacks âœ…
  - Developed API integration tests for ChimeraX endpoints âœ…
  - Created frontend component tests for MoleculeViewer âœ…
  - Implemented dependency verification script and tests âœ…
  - Created documentation for testing OSMesa âœ…
  - Created debugging guide for OSMesa issues âœ…
  - Verified API error handling for missing OSMesa âœ…
  - Created standalone test server for manual verification âœ…
  - Implemented automated test script (run-osmesa-tests.sh) âœ…
  - Fixed multiple TypeScript compilation errors âœ…
- In progress:
  - Completing TypeScript fixes for test framework (80% done)
  - Setting up continuous integration for automated testing
- Blockers:
  - None
- Notes for other devs:
  - Dev 1: Verified your error handling works correctly when OSMesa is missing - manual testing with standalone server confirms proper error response. Fixed several TypeScript issues in the backend code.
  - Dev 2: Created test utilities for frontend MoleculeViewer component. Fixed TypeScript interface issues in multiple frontend components (Sidebar, MolecularViewer, SessionContext).
  - Dev 3: Awaiting CI/CD integration for testing pipeline

Tests confirm that the API correctly handles OSMesa unavailability:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"width":800,"height":600}' http://localhost:9876/api/chimerax/snapshot
{"status":"error","message":"Failed to create snapshot"}
```

ChimeraX logs show the expected error messages:
```
NOTE: Offscreen rendering is not available.
NOTE: ('Unable to load OpenGL library', "dlopen(OSMesa, 0x000A): tried: 'OSMesa' (no such file),...)
ERROR: Unable to save images because OpenGL rendering is not available
```

The automated test script (`run-osmesa-tests.sh`) now provides a complete end-to-end verification of this behavior and properly cleans up all processes.

**Major Breakthrough**: We've discovered that OSMesa is installed via Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew/lib/libOSMesa.dylib`, and we've successfully configured ChimeraX to use these libraries on macOS. The solution was to set both `OSMESA_LIBRARY` and `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables when spawning the ChimeraX process. We've updated the standalone test server with this fix, and it now successfully creates snapshots on macOS without requiring fallback mechanisms.

This is a significant improvement that allows direct server-side rendering even on development machines, making testing more consistent between development and production environments.

This triggers the frontend fallback mechanism correctly, ensuring visualization is always available to users.

**Dev 3:**
- Tasks completed:
  - Created Docker images with ChimeraX and OSMesa support âœ…
  - Implemented testing for OSMesa availability at container startup âœ…
  - Created development environment with hot-reloading âœ…

  - Completed cross-platform compatibility testing between macOS/Linux âœ…
  - Optimized container size and performance âœ…
- In progress:
  - None - all tasks completed
- Blockers:
  - None
- Notes for other devs:
  - Docker containers now properly support OSMesa rendering
  - Use `docker-compose up --build` to test the new setup
  - Check docker-entrypoint.sh logs to verify OSMesa detection
  - Development environment available with `docker-compose --profile dev up -d dev-tools`
  - See docs/docker_setup.md for detailed usage and troubleshooting

**Dev 2:**

  - Implemented ChimeraX API client with robust error handling âœ…
  - Created useChimeraX React hook for seamless API integration âœ…

  - Implemented Three.js-based 3D rendering as primary fallback âœ… 
  - Added static image fallback from external resources (RCSB PDB, PDBe) âœ…
  - Created adaptive UI controls that respond to available rendering capabilities âœ…
  - Implemented clear status indicators and error messaging throughout UI âœ…
  - Added placeholder component for complete rendering failure cases âœ…
  - Documented fallback approach in rendering_fallbacks.md âœ…
  - Ensured responsive design across desktop and tablet viewports âœ…
- In progress:
  - None - all tasks completed

3. âœ… Implement robust solution with proper fallbacks
4. âœ… Integrate backend with frontend visualization
5. ðŸŸ¢ Ensure cross-platform compatibility (in testing)
6. ðŸŸ¡ Add unit and integration tests for the backend
7. âœ… Document frontend rendering fallbacks and usage

## Technical Details

### ChimeraX Rendering Issues

The ChimeraX rendering unavailability was caused by missing OSMesa libraries, which are required for offscreen rendering. We've implemented a multi-layered approach to handle this issue:

#### Backend Fallbacks (Dev 1)
1. **Primary Solution**: Use ChimeraX with OSMesa when available
2. **Fallback 1**: Use ChimeraX with Xvfb as a virtual display when OSMesa is unavailable
3. **Fallback 2**: Generate placeholder images when both rendering methods fail

#### Frontend Fallbacks (Dev 2)
1. **Primary Solution**: Use ChimeraX server-side rendering via REST API
2. **Fallback 1**: Use Three.js WebGL in-browser rendering when ChimeraX is unavailable
3. **Fallback 2**: Display static images from external resources (RCSB PDB, PDBe)
4. **Final Fallback**: Show placeholder molecule icon when all other options fail

### Implementation Notes

#### Backend (Dev 1)
- **ChimeraXProcessManager**: Enhanced to detect platform, check rendering capabilities, and configure environment accordingly.
- **RenderingQueue**: Modified with multiple rendering attempts and fallback options.
- **Placeholder Generation**: Added Node.js canvas library to generate placeholder images when rendering fails.
- **Docker Integration**: Updated startup procedures with comprehensive diagnostics and robust initialization.

#### Frontend (Dev 2)
- **ChimeraXClient**: Service for communicating with ChimeraX API with built-in error handling and fallbacks.
- **useChimeraX Hook**: React hook that manages ChimeraX state, capabilities, and operations.
- **StructureRenderer**: Component with intelligent fallback between rendering methods.
- **EnhancedViewerControls**: UI controls that adapt based on available rendering capabilities.
- **Frontend Documentation**: Added rendering_fallbacks.md with detailed explanation of the fallback system.
