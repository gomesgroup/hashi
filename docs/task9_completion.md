# Task 9: Basic React Frontend - Implementation Details (Updated)

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Task 9, which involved creating a TypeScript-based React frontend for the ChimeraX integration. The frontend provides a user interface for visualizing and manipulating molecular structures through the Hashi backend API.

The frontend implementation focuses on:

2. **Performance**: Optimizing WebGL rendering for complex structures with various representation options
3. **Reliability**: Robust error handling, authentication, and WebSocket reconnection
4. **Accessibility**: Responsive design that works across different devices

## Architecture

The React frontend follows a modern architecture with the following key components:

1. **Component-based structure**: UI elements are broken down into reusable components
2. **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation
3. **Context API**: For global state management (sessions and errors)
4. **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
5. **Styled Components**: For component-scoped styling
6. **React Three Fiber**: For WebGL-based molecular visualization

- Multiple visualization styles (ball-and-stick, stick, sphere, cartoon)
- Color scheme options (by element, chain, residue type, B-factor)
- Display options (hydrogens, labels, background color, quality)
- Camera controls (zoom, pan, rotate)
- Seamless transitions between rendering methods
- Clear status indicators for rendering mode

### 4. Structure Management

- Structure selection interface
- Structure metadata display
- Structure filtering and search

### 5. User Interface

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Session Management

Sessions are managed through the SessionContext provider. The implementation includes:
