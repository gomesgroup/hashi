# Hashi - ChimeraX Web Integration MVP Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Hashi, a web application that integrates with UCSF ChimeraX to provide molecular visualization capabilities through a browser interface. The MVP will focus on delivering core functionality while establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## Current Status

- ✅ ChimeraX is correctly installed and accessible at the specified path
- ✅ TypeScript configuration issues have been resolved
- ✅ ChimeraX integration backend services implemented 
- ✅ Development server enhanced for testing ChimeraX connectivity
- ⏳ WebSocket implementation in progress for real-time updates
- ⏳ React frontend needs integration with backend
- ⏳ Additional core features need completion

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation

   - ✅ Verified Command Service implementation (command execution via REST API)
   - ✅ Verified ChimeraX Controller implementation (API endpoints)
   - ⏳ Complete WebSocket communication for real-time updates
   - ⏳ Complete session creation and restoration logic

4. **Set Up User Authentication System (Complexity: 7/10)**
   - Complete JWT-based authentication service
   - Implement user registration and login endpoints
   - Create middleware for route protection
   - Set up password hashing and verification

5. **Implement File Upload and Structure Management (Complexity: 6/10)**
   - Create secure file upload endpoints
   - Implement file validation for molecular structure formats
   - Complete structure storage service
   - Add version management for structures

6. **Implement Error Handling and Logging System (Complexity: 5/10)**
   - Complete error handler middleware
   - Configure logging system with proper levels
   - Create custom error classes for different scenarios
   - Set up monitoring for ChimeraX processes

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

7. **Develop Core React Frontend Components (Complexity: 7/10)**
   - Build authentication components (login/register forms)
   - Create molecular viewer components
   - Implement session management UI
   - Develop structure management components

8. **Implement API Client Services for Frontend-Backend Communication (Complexity: 6/10)**
   - Create base API client with authentication management
   - Implement services for sessions, structures, and commands
   - Set up WebSocket service for real-time updates
   - Add error handling and retry logic

9. **Implement Basic Structure Visualization Functionality (Complexity: 9/10)**
   - Create rendering service for ChimeraX visualizations
   - Build WebGL-based viewer with camera controls
   - Implement different rendering styles
   - Add UI controls for visualization settings

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Documentation

10. **Implement Testing Infrastructure and MVP Tests (Complexity: 7/10)**
    - Create unit tests for core services
    - Implement integration tests for API endpoints
    - Set up frontend component tests
    - Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

11. **Implement Documentation and User Guides (Complexity: 4/10)**
    - Update API documentation with Swagger
    - Create developer setup guide
    - Write user guides for core features
    - Document ChimeraX integration requirements

## Prioritization and Critical Path

The following tasks form the critical path for MVP delivery:

1. Fix TypeScript Configuration Issues
2. Set Up ChimeraX Integration Backend Services
3. Implement Basic Structure Visualization Functionality
4. Develop Core React Frontend Components
5. Set Up User Authentication System
