# Task 2: ChimeraX Process Management System

## Complexity: 7/10

## Description
Create a system to manage ChimeraX processes that will run in headless/offscreen mode. This module will handle spawning, monitoring, and terminating ChimeraX instances as needed for user sessions.

## Subtasks

1. **Implement ChimeraX Process Spawning**
   - Develop functionality to spawn ChimeraX processes with the correct command-line arguments
   - Implement headless/offscreen mode configuration (`--nogui --offscreen`)
   - Create utilities for detecting ChimeraX installation and verifying functionality
   - Set up process isolation for multiple user sessions

2. **Create Session Management**
   - Develop a session manager to track active ChimeraX processes
   - Create a mapping between session IDs and process information (PID, port)
   - Implement session state persistence
   - Set up cleanup for abandoned sessions

3. **Configure ChimeraX REST API**
   - Implement functionality to start ChimeraX with REST API enabled
   - Create utilities for dynamic port assignment to avoid conflicts
   - Set up REST client for communicating with ChimeraX processes
   - Configure JSON response format for commands

4. **Process Lifecycle Management**
   - Implement process initialization with proper parameters
   - Create process shutdown functionality
   - Develop timeout mechanisms for idle processes
   - Implement process health checks

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Implement error detection for ChimeraX processes
   - Create recovery mechanisms for crashed processes
   - Set up robust error reporting
   - Develop fallback strategies for resource exhaustion

6. **Resource Management**
   - Create functionality to limit the number of concurrent ChimeraX processes
   - Implement idle detection and automatic termination
   - Develop resource usage monitoring for processes
   - Set up cleanup for temporary files

7. **Process Activity Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive logging for process activities
   - Create debugging utilities for process troubleshooting
   - Set up audit trails for session activities
   - Develop monitoring for process health

## Acceptance Criteria
- ChimeraX processes can be spawned in headless mode with REST API enabled
- Each process is isolated and runs on a separate port
- Sessions are properly tracked and mapped to processes
- Idle processes are automatically terminated after a configurable timeout
- Errors are properly handled and reported
- Processes are cleanly terminated when sessions end
- Comprehensive logging captures all relevant process activities

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup (for basic project structure)

## Estimated Time
- 16-20 hours
