   - Develop file browser and history
   - Create download functionality

4. **Implement Basic Visualization**
   - Integrate WebGL visualization library (e.g., 3Dmol.js or NGL)
   - Create molecular viewer component
   - Set up camera controls
   - Develop basic representation styles
   - Create view reset and centering

5. **Add Structure Modification UI**
