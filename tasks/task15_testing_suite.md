# Task 15: Comprehensive Testing Suite

## Complexity: 6/10

## Description
Develop a comprehensive testing suite for the ChimeraX Web Integration, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance tests.

## Subtasks

1. **Implement Backend Unit Tests**
   - Set up testing framework for Node.js
   - Create unit tests for core backend services
   - Implement test mocks and fixtures
   - Set up test data generation
   - Create test coverage reporting

2. **Develop API Integration Tests**
   - Implement API endpoint testing
   - Create test sequences for API workflows
   - Set up authentication testing
   - Develop error case testing
   - Create performance assertions

3. **Create Frontend Component Tests**
   - Set up React testing library
   - Implement component unit tests
   - Create snapshot testing
   - Set up mock API responses
   - Develop UI interaction tests

4. **Implement End-to-End Testing**
   - Set up end-to-end testing framework
   - Create tests for critical user workflows
   - Implement test user accounts
   - Set up test environment configuration
   - Develop visual regression tests

5. **Create Performance Testing**
   - Implement load testing scripts
   - Create stress tests for high concurrency
   - Set up benchmarks for critical operations
   - Develop memory leak detection
   - Create performance regression detection

6. **Develop Security Testing**
   - Implement authentication/authorization tests
   - Create input validation testing
   - Set up API security scanning
   - Develop dependency vulnerability checking
   - Create secure configuration validation

7. **Set up Continuous Integration**
   - Implement CI pipeline configuration
   - Create automated test execution
   - Set up test reporting and notifications
   - Develop test environment provisioning
   - Create deployment verification tests

## Acceptance Criteria
- Backend services have comprehensive unit test coverage
- API endpoints are tested for correctness and edge cases
- Frontend components have unit and integration tests
- End-to-end tests cover critical user workflows
- Performance tests validate system under load
- Security tests verify proper protection mechanisms
- CI pipeline automatically runs tests on code changes

## Dependencies
- All previous tasks should be substantially complete

## Estimated Time
- 12-16 hours
