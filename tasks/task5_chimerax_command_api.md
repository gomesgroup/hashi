# Task 5: ChimeraX Command API

## Complexity: 8/10

## Description
Develop an API for executing ChimeraX commands and processing the results. This will provide a structured interface for the frontend to interact with ChimeraX's powerful command set.

## Subtasks

1. **Create Command Execution Endpoint**
   - Implement POST /api/sessions/{id}/command endpoint
   - Set up request validation and parsing
   - Create command forwarding to ChimeraX REST API
   - Implement response handling and formatting
   - Develop error handling for command execution

2. **Implement Command Validation**
   - Create command syntax validation
   - Implement security checks for command content
   - Set up command parameter validation
   - Develop command whitelist/blacklist mechanism
   - Create input sanitization for command strings

3. **Develop Command Translation Layer**
   - Create high-level operation mapping to ChimeraX commands
   - Implement translation of frontend operations to ChimeraX syntax
   - Set up complex command sequence generation
   - Develop templating for common command patterns
   - Create parameter formatting and escaping

4. **Add Command Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error detection
   - Create user-friendly error messages
   - Set up error classification and reporting
   - Develop recovery strategies for failed commands
   - Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

5. **Implement Response Formatting**
   - Create JSON response structure for command results
   - Implement parsing of ChimeraX output formats
   - Set up result transformation for frontend consumption
   - Develop handling for different output types (text, measurements, structures)
   - Create response compression for large results

6. **Create Command Logging**
   - Implement detailed logging of command execution
   - Create command audit trail
   - Set up performance metrics collection
   - Develop debugging tools for command analysis
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies

7. **Add Batch Command Support**
   - Create functionality for executing multiple commands
   - Implement transaction-like command sequences
   - Set up rollback mechanisms for failed sequences
   - Develop optimization for command batching
   - Create progress reporting for long-running batches

## Acceptance Criteria
- POST /api/sessions/{id}/command endpoint accepts and executes valid ChimeraX commands
- Commands are properly validated and sanitized before execution
- High-level operations from the frontend are correctly translated to ChimeraX syntax
- Command errors are properly detected, handled, and reported
- Command results are formatted as structured JSON responses
- All command executions are properly logged for debugging and auditing
- Batch commands can be executed efficiently and atomically

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup
- Task 2: ChimeraX Process Management System
- Task 3: Session Management API

## Estimated Time
- 20-24 hours
