# Task 14: Resource Monitoring and Management

## Complexity: 5/10

## Description
Implement a system for monitoring and managing server resources to ensure stability and performance. This includes tracking CPU and memory usage, managing ChimeraX processes, and implementing throttling for high-load operations.

## Subtasks

1. **Implement Resource Usage Tracking**
   - Create CPU usage monitoring
   - Implement memory usage tracking
   - Set up disk space monitoring
   - Develop ChimeraX process resource tracking
   - Create resource usage logging

2. **Create Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Implement admin dashboard for resource monitoring
   - Create real-time resource usage graphs
   - Set up user session tracking
   - Develop system health indicators
   - Create alert visualization

3. **Develop Automatic Session Cleanup**
   - Implement idle session detection
   - Create configurable timeout policies
   - Set up automatic resource reclamation
   - Develop user notification for timeouts
   - Create session hibernation (optional)

4. **Add User Resource Limits**
   - Implement per-user resource quotas
   - Create session resource limits
   - Set up configurable limits by user role
   - Develop limit enforcement
   - Create user notification for limit approach

5. **Implement Operation Throttling**
   - Create throttling for high-CPU operations
   - Implement request rate limiting
   - Set up queuing for resource-intensive tasks
   - Develop prioritization system
   - Create feedback for throttled operations

6. **Add Resource Exhaustion Alerting**
   - Implement threshold-based alerts
   - Create notification system for administrators
   - Set up automatic mitigation actions
   - Develop alert logging and history
   - Create alert acknowledgment system

7. **Develop Load Balancing Strategies**
   - Create load distribution for ChimeraX processes
   - Implement dynamic resource allocation
   - Set up job scheduling for intensive operations
   - Develop server health-based routing
   - Create graceful degradation strategies

## Acceptance Criteria
- Resource usage is accurately tracked and logged
- Administrators can monitor system health through a dashboard
- Idle sessions are automatically cleaned up to reclaim resources
- User resource quotas are enforced and prevent system overload
- High-load operations are throttled to maintain system stability
- Resource exhaustion triggers appropriate alerts and mitigations
- Load is balanced effectively across available resources

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup
- Task 2: ChimeraX Process Management System
- Task 3: Session Management API

## Estimated Time
- 10-14 hours
