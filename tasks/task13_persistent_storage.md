# Task 13: Persistent Storage System

## Complexity: 6/10

## Description
Develop a system for persistent storage of molecular structures, sessions, and related metadata. This will enable users to save their work and return to it later, as well as organize and manage their projects.

## Subtasks

1. **Implement Database Schema**
   - Create database schema for user projects and structures
   - Set up database connection and ORM
   - Implement data access layer
   - Create database migration system
   - Develop database backup strategy

2. **Create Save/Load Functionality**
   - Implement structure saving endpoints
   - Create session state persistence
   - Set up ChimeraX session file handling
   - Develop structured metadata storage
   - Create data validation and verification

3. **Implement Metadata Management**
   - Create schema for project metadata (name, description, etc.)
   - Implement metadata CRUD operations
   - Set up tagging system
   - Develop metadata validation
   - Create metadata import/export

4. **Add Version History**
   - Implement versioning for saved structures
   - Create snapshot system for tracking changes
   - Set up version comparison tools
   - Develop version rollback functionality
   - Create version pruning for storage management

5. **Implement Search and Filtering**
   - Create search system for saved structures
   - Implement filtering by metadata
   - Set up sorting options
   - Develop full-text search
   - Create advanced query capabilities

6. **Create Data Export/Import**
   - Implement structure export in multiple formats
   - Create bulk export functionality
   - Set up data import from external sources
   - Develop metadata import/export
   - Create data format conversion utilities

7. **Implement Storage Management**
   - Create storage quota system per user
   - Implement usage monitoring
   - Set up cleanup for orphaned data
   - Develop storage optimization
   - Create disk space monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can save and load structures and sessions
- Metadata is properly stored and can be edited
- Version history tracks changes and allows rollback
- Search and filtering work efficiently for finding saved structures
- Data can be exported and imported in various formats
- Storage quotas are enforced and users can manage their storage usage
- All persistent storage operations are reliable and performant

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup
- Task 3: Session Management API
- Task 4: File Handling System
- Task 12: Authentication and Authorization

## Estimated Time
- 12-16 hours
