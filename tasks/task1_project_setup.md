# Task 1: Project Setup and Node.js Backend Initialization

## Complexity: 3/10

## Description
Create the basic project structure for the ChimeraX Web Integration. This includes setting up the Node.js backend, configuring dependencies, and establishing the development environment.

## Subtasks

1. **Initialize Node.js Project**
   - Create a new Node.js project with `package.json`
   - Set up npm scripts for development, building, and testing
   - Configure TypeScript support

2. **Set up Express.js Backend**
   - Install Express.js and related middleware
   - Create a basic server with error handling
   - Set up API routing structure
   - Implement CORS handling for frontend communication

3. **Create Project Directory Structure**
   - Establish `/src` directory for source code
   - Set up `/client` for React frontend
   - Create `/server` for backend code
   - Organize subdirectories for routes, controllers, services, and utilities

4. **Configure Dependencies**
   - Install core dependencies (Express, body-parser, etc.)
   - Set up development dependencies (nodemon, TypeScript, testing frameworks)
   - Configure package management with npm or yarn

5. **Set up Configuration Files**
   - Create `.gitignore` file
   - Set up `.env.template` for environment variables
   - Configure TypeScript with `tsconfig.json`
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

6. **Configure Development Environment**
   - Set up nodemon for hot reloading during development
   - Configure debugging support
   - Create npm scripts for various development tasks
   - Set up logging configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Node.js project initialized with all required dependencies
- Express server running and responding to basic requests
- Development environment configured with hot reloading
- Directory structure established following best practices
- Configuration files created and properly set up
- Basic logging and error handling implemented

## Dependencies
- None (this is a foundational task)

## Estimated Time
- 4-6 hours
