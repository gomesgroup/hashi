# Task 10: Advanced Visualization Features

## Complexity: 8/10

## Description
Implement advanced molecular visualization features in the React frontend, including different representation styles, selection tools, measurement capabilities, and customization options.

## Subtasks

1. **Implement Visualization Modes**
   - Create ball-and-stick representation
   - Implement ribbon/cartoon visualization for proteins
   - Set up surface rendering options
   - Develop wireframe and stick modes
   - Create space-filling (CPK) visualization

2. **Create Selection Interface**
   - Implement atom selection tools
   - Create residue and chain selection
   - Set up sequence-based selection
   - Develop selection expression editor
   - Create selection storage and recall

3. **Add Measurement Tools**
   - Implement distance measurement between atoms
   - Create angle measurement tool
   - Set up dihedral angle measurement
   - Develop area and volume measurement
   - Create measurement display and persistence

4. **Support Multiple Structures**
   - Implement multi-model visualization
   - Create structure alignment tools
   - Set up individual visibility toggling
   - Develop model transformation controls
   - Create model comparison features

5. **Implement Clipping and Cross-Sections**
   - Create clipping plane controls
   - Implement cross-section visualization
   - Set up slab mode for selective viewing
   - Develop clipping plane persistence
   - Create interactive plane adjustment

6. **Add Color Schemes**
   - Implement standard coloring schemes (element, residue, etc.)
   - Create custom color assignment tools
   - Set up color by property (charge, hydrophobicity, etc.)
   - Develop color scheme editing
   - Create color legend display

7. **Create Animation Capabilities**
   - Implement trajectory playback controls
   - Create keyframe animation for transitions
   - Set up rotation and camera movement animation
   - Develop animation speed controls
   - Create animation recording and export

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple visualization modes are available and correctly render structures
- Selection tools allow precise selection of atoms, residues, and chains
- Measurement tools accurately display distances, angles, and other measurements
- Multiple structures can be visualized simultaneously
- Clipping planes and cross-sections work correctly
- Color schemes can be applied and customized
- Animations function smoothly for trajectories and transitions

## Dependencies
- Task 9: Basic React Frontend
- Task 5: ChimeraX Command API
- Task 6: Structure Retrieval and Conversion API
- Task 7: Structure Modification Endpoints

## Estimated Time
- 20-24 hours
