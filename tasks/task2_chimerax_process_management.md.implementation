# Task 2 Implementation: ChimeraX Process Management System

## Implementation Overview

The ChimeraX Process Management System has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Core Service: ChimeraXProcessManager**
   - Implemented as a singleton service in `src/server/services/ChimeraXProcessManager.ts`
   - Provides functionality for spawning, monitoring, and terminating ChimeraX processes
   - Handles dynamic port assignment, command execution, and process lifecycle management

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Created TypeScript interfaces in `src/server/types/chimerax.ts`
   - Defined types for process information, command results, and process status

3. **REST API Controller**
   - Implemented controller in `src/server/controllers/chimeraxController.ts`
   - Exposes HTTP endpoints for process management operations
   - Handles error cases and provides consistent response format

4. **REST API Routes**
   - Set up routes in `src/server/routes/chimeraxRoutes.ts`
   - Integrated with existing API router in `src/server/routes/api.ts`

5. **Unit Tests**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/ChimeraXProcessManager.test.ts`
   - Covers all core functions including process spawning, monitoring, and termination

6. **Documentation**
   - Added detailed API documentation in `docs/chimerax-process-manager.md`
   - Created usage example in `src/examples/chimeraxProcessExample.ts`

## Key Features Implemented

### Process Spawning and Management
- Spawns ChimeraX processes with appropriate flags (`--nogui --offscreen --nosilent --noexit`)
- Configures each process with REST API enabled on unique ports
- Tracks processes by session ID with mapping to ports and PIDs
- Handles process initialization, monitoring, and termination

### Error Handling and Recovery
- Implements error detection for process startup and command execution
- Provides detailed error logging and reporting
- Handles process crashes and port conflicts
- Implements automatic recovery for failed operations

### Resource Management
- Limits the number of concurrent ChimeraX instances
- Implements idle detection and automatic termination
- Provides dynamic port assignment to avoid conflicts
- Ensures proper cleanup of resources when processes terminate

### Process Monitoring
- Implements regular health checks for running processes
- Detects and handles zombie processes
- Monitors REST API availability for each process
- Provides methods for manual intervention when needed

### Command Execution
- Sends commands to ChimeraX processes via REST API
- Handles response parsing and error detection
- Updates activity timestamps to track idle processes
- Provides consistent error handling and reporting

## Testing and Validation

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with the following approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests with mocked child processes and network calls
2. **Integration Testing**: Example script demonstrating the full process lifecycle
3. **Error Case Testing**: Tests for handling process limits, spawn failures, and command errors

## Subtasks Completed

1. ✅ **ChimeraX Process Spawning**
   - Implemented spawning with correct command-line arguments
   - Configured headless/offscreen mode
   - Created process isolation for multiple sessions

2. ✅ **Session Management**
   - Developed tracking for active ChimeraX processes
   - Created mapping between session IDs and process information
   - Implemented cleanup for abandoned sessions

3. ✅ **ChimeraX REST API Configuration**
   - Implemented REST API enabling on startup
   - Created dynamic port assignment
   - Set up command execution via REST API

4. ✅ **Process Lifecycle Management**
   - Implemented initialization with proper parameters
   - Created process shutdown functionality
   - Developed timeout mechanisms for idle processes
   - Implemented process health checks

5. ✅ **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Implemented error detection for ChimeraX processes
   - Created robust error reporting
   - Developed fallback strategies for resource exhaustion

6. ✅ **Resource Management**
   - Created limits for concurrent ChimeraX processes
   - Implemented idle detection and automatic termination
   - Developed resource cleanup mechanisms

7. ✅ **Process Activity Logging**
   - Implemented comprehensive logging for process activities
   - Created debugging utilities for troubleshooting
   - Set up monitoring for process health

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Spawn a ChimeraX process
const process = await chimeraXProcessManager.spawnChimeraXProcess();

// Send a command to the process
const result = await chimeraXProcessManager.sendCommand(process.id, 'open 1zik');

// Terminate the process when done
await chimeraXProcessManager.terminateChimeraXProcess(process.id);
```

## API Endpoints

The following REST API endpoints are available:

- `POST /api/chimerax/processes`: Create a new ChimeraX process
- `GET /api/chimerax/processes`: Get all ChimeraX processes
- `GET /api/chimerax/processes/:id`: Get a specific ChimeraX process
- `DELETE /api/chimerax/processes/:id`: Terminate a ChimeraX process
- `POST /api/chimerax/processes/:id/command`: Send a command to a ChimeraX process
- `POST /api/chimerax/cleanup`: Clean up idle ChimeraX processes

## Future Improvements

- Implement resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory)
- Add process recovery for critical sessions
- Create persistent storage for session state
- Implement more advanced error recovery strategies
- Add support for ChimeraX version detection and compatibility checks
