# Task 4: File Handling System

## Complexity: 5/10

## Description
Create a system for handling molecular structure files, including upload, storage, validation, and cleanup. This system will manage the file operations needed for ChimeraX to process molecular structures.

## Subtasks

1. **Implement File Upload Functionality**
   - Create API endpoints for file uploads
   - Implement multipart form data handling
   - Set up file streaming for large uploads
   - Develop progress tracking for uploads
   - Create error handling for upload failures

2. **Create Temporary File Storage**
   - Implement temporary storage directory structure
   - Create unique file naming conventions
   - Set up session-specific directories
   - Develop cleanup mechanisms for temporary files
   - Implement file system monitoring

3. **Implement File Format Validation**
   - Create file type validation for molecular formats
   - Implement format-specific validation checks
   - Set up size limits and validation
   - Develop error reporting for invalid files
   - Create security checks for uploaded files

4. **Develop File Conversion Utilities**
   - Implement ChimeraX-based format conversion
   - Create utilities for common format conversions
   - Set up file format detection
   - Develop error handling for conversion failures
   - Implement conversion logging

5. **Create File Retrieval Endpoints**
   - Implement download endpoints for structures
   - Create streaming for large file downloads
   - Set up content-type handling for different formats
   - Develop access control for file retrieval
   - Implement file metadata endpoints

6. **Implement Persistent Storage**
   - Create permanent storage for saved structures
   - Implement database integration for file metadata
   - Set up versioning for saved structures
   - Develop user-specific storage directories
   - Create storage space management

7. **Add File Cleanup Mechanisms**
   - Implement automatic cleanup for temporary files
   - Create scheduled cleanup jobs
   - Set up orphaned file detection
   - Develop storage space monitoring
   - Implement cleanup logging

## Acceptance Criteria
- Molecular structure files can be uploaded in various formats (PDB, SDF, MOL, CIF, XYZ, etc.)
- Uploaded files are properly validated for format and security
- Files are stored in temporary locations accessible to ChimeraX processes
- ChimeraX can convert between different file formats as needed
- Modified structures can be downloaded in various formats
- Saved structures are properly stored in persistent storage
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up after sessions end

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup
- Task 2: ChimeraX Process Management System
- Task 3: Session Management API

## Estimated Time
- 10-14 hours
